## Problems I focus on {.build}

Why do we observe increases in negative health risk during Adolescence?

Can we gain insight into the causes of adolescent risk-tolerance by If we understand individual differences in thought and behavior as _strategies_ for satisfying fundamental motivations?

## Methodological approaches

- Modeling development (adolescence, adulthood)
    - Models encode hypotheses
        - Networks versus latent variables ([Network model of personality](https://figshare.com/articles/A_Network_Approach_to_Characterizing_Personality_in_the_Life_and_Time_Longitudinal_Sample/1447279/2))
        - Distinguishing sources of variance ([RI-CLPM](https://jflournoy.github.io/2017/10/20/riclpm-lavaan-demo/), LCM-SR)
- Modeling behavior
    - Increase reliability of individual differences in behavior (Yellow Light Game)
    - Allow measurement of latent process (Social Probabilistic Learning Task)

# Adolescent risk taking {.build}

The big question: Why do negative health outcomes increase in adolescence?

## Negative health outcomes and health risking behavior

<img src='https://gitlab.com/jflournoy/Adolescent_Injury_Risk/raw/master/unintentional_injury_data_by_sex.png' width = 60% style='float:right' />

- Increases in unintentional injury
- ... alcohol and drug abuse (Hooshmand, Willoughby, & Good, 2012)
- ... risky sexual behavior (Stevenson, Zimmerman, & Caldwell, 2007)

## Changes in risk and reward processing

Explanations focus on 

- Reward sensitivity during risky choices (e.g., Casey, 2015)
- ... in peer contexts (e.g., Peake et al., 2013, Silva et al., 2016).

# The Yellow Light Game {.build}

Characterizing a laboratory paradigm commonly used to investigate risk decisions.

## The Stoplight Game

The Stoplight Game (Steinberg et al, 2008) has been used in dozens of experiments as a measure of risk-taking 

- Small correlations with self report sensation seeking (r=.2; Harden et al., 2017; Steinberg et al. 2008)
- Game-elicited neural response correlates with convergent measures (Kahn et al., 2014)
- However, some aspects of this task remain unclear
    - Making a risky choice also increases task performance (stop = -3s, EV of go = -1.8s)
    - Most variance is not shared with convergent measures (Harden et al, 2017)

## The psychometric properties of Stoplight

[Harden et al. 2017](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2016.12.007): 398 twins, 4 factors capture variance of a wide range of cognitive control and incentive processing tasks 

- Reward-seeking factor loadings (A = .66, E = .34)

        Stoplight: intersections  0.32
        IGT: Good decks           0.56
        IGT: Bad decks            0.22
        Delay Discounting         0.15
        BART: Avg. adjusted pumps 0.47	
        Sensation seeking         0.16
- Stoplight *unique* variance: 78% is non-shared env + measurement error
- A lot of unaccounted for variance

## Aims of the Yellow Light Game study

1. Increase precision of task design
2. Through modeling, Improve relaibility

## Aim 1: Task design improvements

[The Yellow Light Game](https://dsn.uoregon.edu/research/yellow-light-game/) software is Customizable. 

In the configuration for this study:

- We can distinguish propensity to choose risk option, and learning
- Performance insensitive to overall proportion of risk choice
- But one can learn to increase performance

## YLG Task Protocol description

<img src = 'stoplight.jpg' style = 'width: 50%; float: right' />

- Each intersection has 1 of 3 risk levels 
- Risk levels correspond to different yellow light onsets
    - 12 "middle" P(crash) = .5
    - 4 "late" P(crash) = .25
    - 4 "early" P(crash) = .75
- Driving simulation, 8 runs, 20 intersections per run
- Run 5 and 6 (**peer**): watched by two "peers" via remote desktop after cyberball inclusion
- Run 7 and 8 (**excl**): watched after being excluded in cyberball

## Aim 2: Modeling improvements

a. Can we improve between-person proportion of variance?
b. Can we distinguish risk-tolerance from learning?
    - ... and are there differences in peer effects across parameters?
c. How do these modeling choices affect convergent correlations?

## The data to model

N = 174, all analyses available in R package: [`ylglearning`](https://jflournoy.github.io/ylglearning/)

<img src = 'https://jflournoy.github.io/ylglearning/articles/ylg_descriptives_and_diagnostics_files/figure-html/rawpropplot-1.png' style = 'width: 100%' />

## 2a. Improve between-person variance

Logistic regression captures the common measure of simple proportion of non-stop intersections.

ICC<sub>pGo</sub> = [0.12](https://jflournoy.github.io/ylglearning/articles/ylg_descriptives_and_diagnostics.html#task-reliability)

This could be one explanation for the somewhat small correlations in the literature.

## 2a. Diagnosing this low ICC

Structure of task behavior: is using simple bernoulli process not appropriate?  

- Participants tend not to make the same decision twice <img src = 'https://jflournoy.github.io/ylglearning/articles/ylg_descriptives_and_diagnostics_files/figure-html/autocorrelationvisualization-1.png' style = 'width:50%; float:right' />
- "Last decision 'Go'?" parameter increases ICC from **.12 to .32**
- But now we have two variables to interpret!

## 2a. Reward-learning?

- [Rescorla-Wagner](https://jflournoy.shinyapps.io/rw_model/) (left) is not better than logistic regression (right) <div style = 'float:right;width:100%'><img src = 'https://jflournoy.github.io/ylglearning/articles/ylg_expanding_the_logistic_model_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png' style = 'width: 50%' /><img src = 'https://jflournoy.github.io/ylglearning/articles/ylg_expanding_the_logistic_model_files/figure-html/brmIxTypeppcheck-1.png' style = 'width: 50%' /></div>

## 2a. Conclusion

Yes, accounting for more complicated task-behavior structure improves reliability (with a possible loss of interpretability). 

## 2b. Distinguish learning and risk tolerance

<img src = 'https://jflournoy.github.io/ylglearning/articles/ylg_questionnaire_analyses_files/figure-html/plotfittedpreds-1.png' style = 'width: 95%' />

## 2b. Distinguish learning and risk tolerance

<img src = 'https://jflournoy.github.io/ylglearning/articles/ylg_questionnaire_analyses_files/figure-html/plotfittedpreds-2.png' style = 'width: 95%' />

## 2b. Conclusion {.build}

There are some differences in behavior between "learnable" intersections.

Learning especially for late-onset intersections. 

Evidence for risk-tolerance increases for "Go"-after-"Go" non-learnable intersections.

**Task behavior is more complex than we may have appreciated.**

## 2c. Convergent relations between Sensation seeking and "Go" behavior

In this model, [63%](https://jflournoy.github.io/ylglearning/articles/ylg_questionnaire_analyses.html) of the variance is between-person.

Does modeling make a difference?

Compare parameters during _Alone_ condition

- Simple proportions model: P(Go)
- Full mode: P(Go|stop)<sub>M</sub>, P(Go|Go)<sub>M</sub>
- Self-report sensation seeking from the UPPS-P (Cyders et al., 2007; Whiteside & Lynam, 2001).

## Conclusions

- Is learning motivation _and_ risk tolerance modulated by peer experiences?
    - Why? To what end?
- Does more fine-grained task modeling improve correlations with convergent measures?
    - If so, does this allow us to better generalize this task as a measurement of reward-seeking or risk tolerance?

# 4. Measuring adolescent-developing motivations

My approach: How do the motivations behind "motivated adolescent behavior" change?

## Why motivation? {.build}

Many have argued that adolescent changes in reward seeking and risk tolerance may be adaptive:

>- Detachment from family
>- Exploration of environment

Why?

## Motives and goals matter

Understanding function of changes in reward processing is necessary for complete description of its consequences:

- Health risking behavior
- Psychopathology?

## Function matters for intervention

- Interventions that satisfice motives will be more successful (Ellis et al, 2014)
- Motives guide perception and selection of opportunities for behavior
    - That is, motives help us understand _what might have value_

## Adolescent developing motives

- Two prominent motives: Status, Mate-seeking
- Fundamental Social Motives captures these 
- Research is either absent or self-report
- Need for new measurement

## Reinforcement learning paradigm

- Behavioral
- Mechanistic
- Motivational potentiation of learning

## Dissertation Goals

Two mutually reinforcing goals:

1. Preliminary validation of learning task as measure of motives (and motive effects on learning)
2. Exploration of links between multiple measures of motives, related constructs, and outcomes

## Aims

- Aim 1a: Does framing reinforcement learning with (mate-seeking and status) motivational contexts potentiate learning?
- Aim 1b: How does motivational potentiation of learning covary with development?

## Aims

- Aim 2: Does the motivational potentiation of learning relate to a constellation of self-report measures that theoretically ought to demonstrate convergence? Specifically, 
    - \((i)\) what is the relation between motivational potentiation and self-report fundamental social motives; 
    - \((ii)\) what is the relation between self-report fundamental social motives and motive-congruent outcomes; and 
    - \((iii)\) what is the relation between motivational potentiation and motive-congruent outcomes.

## Aims

- Aim 3a: Do close others perceive individual differences in motives that are reflected in motivational learning potentiation?
- Aim 3b: Is there agreement between close others and the self in perceptions of fundamental social motives?

_NUMBERS ARE NOT RIGHT_

>- N<sub>Adol</sub> = 100
>- N<sub>Coll</sub> = 167
>- N<sub>Inf</sub> = 200

## Future directions

- Connecting motives to means
    - How does exploitation of opportunities reveal motives?
    - How to provide opportunities for socially-valued means?
- Thwarted motives
    - Relation to stress

## [Network model of personality](https://figshare.com/articles/A_Network_Approach_to_Characterizing_Personality_in_the_Life_and_Time_Longitudinal_Sample/1447279/2))

Bootstrapped, regularized partial-correlation networks and network statistics (using UO high-performance computing cluster)

![](personality_network.png)

## Centrality statistcs

E.g., betweenness: how many shortest routes does a node sit on?

![](betweenness.png)

## Advantages and pitfalls of the approach

- The strength: 
    - Rich characterization of mediating relations
    - Characterize propagation
    - Modularity without unknown causes
- The pitfalls: 
    - Mediation 
    - Unclear how to characterize uncertainty
    - Each node is a construct (with measurement issues)

## Future directions

Claims about ties between nodes strengthened by

- High-frequency longitudinal data
- Appropriate modeling of variance (e.g. LCM-SR, RI-CLPM)
    - Strengthens claim that effects are within-person 
    - Between-person correlations make bad edges
