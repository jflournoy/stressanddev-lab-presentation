# 4. Measuring adolescent-developing motivations

My approach: How do the motivations behind "motivated adolescent behavior" change?

## Why motivation? {.build}

Many have argued that adolescent changes in reward seeking and risk tolerance may be adaptive:

>- Detachment from family
>- Exploration of environment

Why?

## Motives and goals matter

Understanding function of changes in reward processing is necessary for complete description of its consequences:

- Health risking behavior
- Psychopathology?

## Function matters for intervention

- Interventions that satisfice motives will be more successful (Ellis et al, 2014)
- Motives guide perception and selection of opportunities for behavior
    - That is, motives help us understand _what might have value_

## Adolescent developing motives

- Two prominent motives: Status, Mate-seeking
- Fundamental Social Motives captures these 
- Research is either absent or self-report
- Need for new measurement

## Reinforcement learning paradigm

- Behavioral
- Mechanistic
- Motivational potentiation of learning

## Dissertation Goals

Two mutually reinforcing goals:

1. Preliminary validation of learning task as measure of motives (and motive effects on learning)
2. Exploration of links between multiple measures of motives, related constructs, and outcomes

## Aims

- Aim 1a: Does framing reinforcement learning with (mate-seeking and status) motivational contexts potentiate learning?
- Aim 1b: How does motivational potentiation of learning covary with development?

## Aims

- Aim 2: Does the motivational potentiation of learning relate to a constellation of self-report measures that theoretically ought to demonstrate convergence? Specifically, 
    - \((i)\) what is the relation between motivational potentiation and self-report fundamental social motives; 
    - \((ii)\) what is the relation between self-report fundamental social motives and motive-congruent outcomes; and 
    - \((iii)\) what is the relation between motivational potentiation and motive-congruent outcomes.

## Aims

- Aim 3a: Do close others perceive individual differences in motives that are reflected in motivational learning potentiation?
- Aim 3b: Is there agreement between close others and the self in perceptions of fundamental social motives?

## Social Probabilistic Learning Task

## Progress

_NUMBERS ARE NOT RIGHT_

>- N<sub>Adol</sub> = 100
>- N<sub>Coll</sub> = 167
>- N<sub>Inf</sub> = 200

## Future directions

- Connecting motives to means
    - How does exploitation of opportunities reveal motives?
    - How to provide opportunities for socially-valued means?
- Thwarted motives
    - Relation to stress

# Extras

## [Network model of personality](https://figshare.com/articles/A_Network_Approach_to_Characterizing_Personality_in_the_Life_and_Time_Longitudinal_Sample/1447279/2))

Bootstrapped, regularized partial-correlation networks and network statistics (using UO high-performance computing cluster)

## Centrality statistcs

E.g., betweenness: how many shortest routes does a node sit on?

![](betweenness.png)

## Advantages and pitfalls of the approach

- The strength: 
    - Rich characterization of mediating relations
    - Characterize propagation
    - Modularity without unknown causes
- The pitfalls: 
    - Mediation 
    - Unclear how to characterize uncertainty
    - Each node is a construct (with measurement issues)

## Future directions

Claims about ties between nodes strengthened by

- High-frequency longitudinal data
- Appropriate modeling of variance (e.g. LCM-SR, RI-CLPM)
    - Strengthens claim that effects are within-person 
    - Between-person correlations make bad edges
