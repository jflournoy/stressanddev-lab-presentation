# 1. Neural correlates of empathy-motivated prosocial behavior <small>([2016](https://dx.doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/RJH48))</small>

Do individual differences in empathic concern predict future prosocial behavior? Is this mediated by "affective resonance" neural processes?

## Empathy and Prosocial Behavior

*Empathic concern:* Sympathy, compassion; aligned emotions _for_ another person's suffering. 

Evidence of association between EC and prosocial behavior throughout development (Barr & Higgins-Dâ€™Alessandro, 2007; Brownell et 
al., 2013; Eisenberg, 2003; Eisenberg et al., 1991; Eisenberg et al., 1987; Farrant et
al., 2012; 
Litvack-Miller et al., 1997)

## What reactive neural processes are involved?

Empathic concern is an emotional reaction that will be activated by other people's emotional expressions.

Given that a neural region is functionally active in response to other people's emotions, does that functional activation explain some of the link between EC and prosocial behavior?

What does a particular region's involvement tell us about this link?

## The study

Two waves, only participants with fMRI at wave 1 & 2.

>- $N = 56 (N_{\text{male}} = 26$)
>- fMRI during passive viewing of emotional faces (NimStim).
>- Questionnaires

## fMRI paradigm

## Quesitonnaire Measures

Measures of target constructs:

- Interpersonal Reactivity Index (Davis, 1983)
    - Empathic Concern
    - Personal Distress
- Questions from the 4-H Study of Positive Youth Development survey (Lerner et al., 2005)
    - >During an average week, how many 
hours do you spend helping other people without getting paid (such as helping out at a hospital, 
daycare center, food shelf, youth program, community service agency, or doing other things)
    - Item asking if they are often kind to other children.

```

## Results - Mediation {.build}

IFG (peak at [[-51, 20, 25](http://neurosynth.org/locations/?y=20&x=-52&z=26)]) mediates relation between wave 1 EC and wave 2 PSB

$\Delta 1 \text{SD}_{\text{EC}} = \Delta 0.38 \text{SD}_{\text{PSB}}$

Proportion of effect mediated = .51, p = .01.

lIFG: Language, cognitive control.

Perhaps EC promotes PSB via linguistic processing of emotional cues.

## Limitations

or, what I've learned since then:

1. AFNI's 3dClustSim was buggy (Eklund et al., 2016)
2. Mediation is fraught (Bullock et al., 2010)
    - [Simulations](https://jflournoy.github.io/2016/09/02/mediation_power/#misspecification): With data from three variables that are _only_ correlated, mediation models that _don't_ control for prior levels of both the outcome and mediator systematically show evidence of mediation.
    - Even in longitudinal data, model-misspecification leads to eroneous conclusions.
    
# 2. Interactions between personality and values in adult development <small>(submitted)</small>

Personality changes throughout adulthood. Do changes in values drive some of this change? How to best model these influences?

## The study

>- Cohort-sequential, 4 waves
>- Nationally representative
>- N = 879, 44% male, age 18&ndash;63, M = 36 (10.5)

## Measures

- Personality
    - Big five, aspects, and super-factors
- Values 
    - Mature values
    - Unmitigated self interest
    - Materialism
    - Financial aspirations
    - Individualism & collectivism

## Model for longitudinal change

Cross-lagged panel model, but _better_:

<big>The Latent Curve Model with Structured Residuals</big> (LCM-SR; Curran et al., 2013)

![Growth curve with cross lagged residuals](lcmsr.png)

## Why not cross-lagged panel models?

Models need to account for both between- and within-person variance or risk extreme bias (Hamaker et al., 2015).

```{r, out.width = "350px"}
knitr::include_graphics("riclpmsims.png")
```

Figure 2. Simulations reveal misspecification bias

## [Results](https://jflournoy.github.io/lnt_pxvx/bivariate_LCMSR_models.html#parameter-estimates)

_A lot_ of intercept-to-intercept correlations at p < .005. 

For example, Agreeableness (and facets) intercept negatively correlate with financial aspirations, materialism, unmitigated self-interest, and individualism.

Lagged effects:

- Mature Values $+ \rightarrow$ Openness 
- Materialism  $- \rightarrow$ Social-self-regulation
- Vertical Individualism $- \rightarrow$ Compassion, Politeness, Intellect, and Openness. 
- Openness $\leftarrow - \rightarrow$ Vertical Individualism

## Substantive takeaway

- Evidence _against_ essentialist trait perspective
- Culture shapes the person (possibly more at different ages)
- Primarily between-person correlation, so values perhaps not a robust route for culture

## One step more to network Models

- Massively bi-variate approach is lacking -- effects in isolation
- Imagine a web of cross-lagged effects between values and personality
- Good recent work on psychological networks [[1](http://psych-networks.com/7-new-papers-network-replicability/), [2](http://sachaepskamp.com/Dissertation)]
    - Tests idea that certain constructs (e.g., mental illness) are not best characterized by unitary latent causes.
- Preliminary work on this data set is promising

## [Networks of personality](https://figshare.com/articles/A_Network_Approach_to_Characterizing_Personality_in_the_Life_and_Time_Longitudinal_Sample/1447279/2)

Bootstrapped, regularized partial-correlation networks and network statistics (using UO high-performance computing cluster)

## Centrality statistcs

E.g., betweenness: how many shortest routes does a node sit on?

![](betweenness.png)

## Advantages and pitfalls of the approach

- The strength: 
    - Rich characterization of mediating relations
    - Characterize propagation
    - Modularity without unknown causes
- The pitfalls: 
    - Mediation 
    - Unclear how to characterize uncertainty
    - Each node is a construct (with measurement issues)

## Future directions

Claims about ties between nodes strengthened by

- High-frequency longitudinal data
- Appropriate modeling of variance (e.g. LCM-SR, RI-CLPM)
    - Strengthens claim that effects are within-person 
    - Between-person correlations make bad edges

# Interim summary

Model misspecification can _easily_ lead one to make categorically incorrect decisions

Different models can powerfully encode different hypotheses

# Adolescent risk taking

The big question: Why do negative health outcomes increase in adolescence?

## Uncertain reward

<img src='https://gitlab.com/jflournoy/Adolescent_Injury_Risk/raw/master/unintentional_injury_data_by_sex.png' width = 60% style='float:right' />
Focus on choosing risky rewards, and peer influences.

# 3. The Yellow Light Game and adolescent risk-taking

Characterizing a laboratory task commonly used to investigage risk decisions.

## Characterizing risk with Stoplight

The Stoplight Game (Steinberg et al, 2008) has been used in dozens of experiments.

- Neural correlates with convergent measures (e.g., sensation-seeking; Kahn et al., 2014)
- Small correlations with self report sensation seeking (r=.2; Harden et al., 2017)
- Some problems
    - Performance and risk choice (stop = -3s, EV go = -1.8s)
    - Different operationalizations of risk (prop "go" v. RT for "stop")
    - Non-decisions (button press for stop only)
    - A lot of non-systematic variance, poor cor with other convergent measures (Harden, 2017)

## The Yellow Light Game

The [YLG](https://dsn.uoregon.edu/research/yellow-light-game/) software is Customizable. This version:

- Performance balanced between risk and safe options
- Decision is required
- Possible optimal mix of risk and non-risk
- Distinguish propensity to choose risk option, and learning

## Task description

- 8 runs, 20 intersections per run
- 3 Risk levels with different yellow light onsets
    - 12 "middle" with P(crash | go) = .5
    - 4 "late" with P(crash | go) = .25
    - 4 "early" with P(crash | go) = .75
- Run 5 and 6 (**peer**): watched by two "peers" via remote desktop after cyberball inclusion
- Run 7 and 8 (**excl**): watched after being excluded in cyberball

## Modeling questions

>- Problems with simple bernoulli model?
>- Are individuals distinguishable?
>- Does learning occur?
>- If so, does it follow reward-learning expectations? 
>- Is learning or risk sensitive to peer manipulations?
>- Do individual differences correspond to convergent measures?

## Many data

All analyses in R package: [`ylglearning`](https://jflournoy.github.io/ylglearning/)

<img src = 'https://jflournoy.github.io/ylglearning/articles/ylg_descriptives_and_diagnostics_files/figure-html/rawpropplot-1.png' style = 'width: 100%' />

## Preliminary results

- Participants tend not to make the same decision twice <img src = 'https://jflournoy.github.io/ylglearning/articles/ylg_descriptives_and_diagnostics_files/figure-html/autocorrelationvisualization-1.png' style = 'width:35%; float:right' />
- Are risk-averse on average,   
`r paste(paste0(c('P(Go) = ', ' [', ', ', ']'), c(round(inv_logit(c(-0.39, -0.49, -0.28)),2), '')), collapse = '')`
    - $P(\text{Go}_t | \text{Go}_{t-1}) = .32$, $P(\text{Go}_t | \text{Stop}_{t-1}) = .46$
    - "Last choice" parameter increases ICC from .12 to .32
    
## Reward-learning?

- [RW](https://jflournoy.shinyapps.io/rw_model/) is not better than logistic regression <div style = 'float:right;width:100%'><img src = 'https://jflournoy.github.io/ylglearning/articles/ylg_expanding_the_logistic_model_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png' style = 'width: 50%' /><img src = 'https://jflournoy.github.io/ylglearning/articles/ylg_expanding_the_logistic_model_files/figure-html/brmIxTypeppcheck-1.png' style = 'width: 50%' /></div>

## Evidence of learning

TABLE ABOUT HERE

## Peer influences on learning?

Do people perform more optimally in either of the peer conditions?

Are indices of learning separable from indices of risk-tolerance?

## Conclusions

- Is learning motivation _and_ risk tolerance modulated by peer experiences?
    - Why? To what end?
- Does more fine-grained task modeling improve correlations with convergent measures?
    - If so, does this allow us to better generalize this task as a measurement of reward-seeking or risk tolerance?

# 4. Measuring adolescent-developing motivations

My approach: How do the motivations behind "motivated adolescent behavior" change?

## Why motivation? {.build}

Many have argued that adolescent changes in reward seeking and risk tolerance may be adaptive:

>- Detachment from family
>- Exploration of environment

Why?

## Motives and goals matter

Understanding function of changes in reward processing is necessary for complete description of its consequences:

- Health risking behavior
- Psychopathology?

## Function matters for intervention

- Interventions that satisfice motives will be more successful (Ellis et al, 2014)
- Motives guide perception and selection of opportunities for behavior
    - That is, motives help us understand _what might have value_

## Adolescent developing motives

- Two prominent motives: Status, Mate-seeking
- Fundamental Social Motives captures these 
- Research is either absent or self-report
- Need for new measurement

## Reinforcement learning paradigm

- Behavioral
- Mechanistic
- Motivational potentiation of learning

## Dissertation Goals

Two mutually reinforcing goals:

1. Preliminary validation of learning task as measure of motives (and motive effects on learning)
2. Exploration of links between multiple measures of motives, related constructs, and outcomes

## Aims

- Aim 1a: Does framing reinforcement learning with (mate-seeking and status) motivational contexts potentiate learning?
- Aim 1b: How does motivational potentiation of learning covary with development?

## Aims

- Aim 2: Does the motivational potentiation of learning relate to a constellation of self-report measures that theoretically ought to demonstrate convergence? Specifically, 
    - \((i)\) what is the relation between motivational potentiation and self-report fundamental social motives; 
    - \((ii)\) what is the relation between self-report fundamental social motives and motive-congruent outcomes; and 
    - \((iii)\) what is the relation between motivational potentiation and motive-congruent outcomes.

## Aims

- Aim 3a: Do close others perceive individual differences in motives that are reflected in motivational learning potentiation?
- Aim 3b: Is there agreement between close others and the self in perceptions of fundamental social motives?

    - How does exploitation of opportunities reveal motives?
    - How to provide opportunities for socially-valued means?
- Thwarted motives
    - Relation to stress
