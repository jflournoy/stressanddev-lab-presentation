## Introduction

My work in graduate school has been diverse

- Social 
- Neuroscience
- Development
- Personality

## Interests

My interests are both

- Substantive
    - Adolescent, motivated decision-making
    - Development of stable individual differences
- Methodological
    - Cognitive models of behavior
    - Refined models of development
    - Emphasis on uncertainty

## Projects

Four projects (and what I've learned about doing science from some of them):

1. Neural correlates of empathy-motivated prosocial behavior
2. Interactions between personality and values in adult development
3. The Yellow Light Game and adolescent risk-taking
4. Measuring adolescent-developing motivations

# Neural correlates of empathy-motivated prosocial behavior

Do individual differences in empathic concern predict future prosocial behavior? Is this mediated by "affective resonance" neural processes?

## Empathy and Prosocial Behavior

*Empathic concern:* Sympathy, compassion; aligned emotions _for_ another person's suffering. 

Evidence of association between EC and prosocial behavior throughout development (Barr & Higgins-Dâ€™Alessandro, 2007; Brownell et 
al., 2013; Eisenberg, 2003; Eisenberg et al., 1991; Eisenberg et al., 1987; Farrant et
al., 2012; 
Litvack-Miller et al., 1997)

## What reactive neural processes are involved?

Empathic concern is an emotional reaction that will be activated by other people's emotional expressions.

Given that a neural region is functionally active in response to other people's emotions, does that functional activation explain some of the link between EC and prosocial behavior?

What does a particular region's involvement tell us about this link?
